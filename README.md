# 2024-RebelLocate
A machine learning program designed to guess the location of images using coordinate data and Python distance algorithms, CNN, and KNN.

The program utilizes a self-sourced image database containing over 6,000 individual images across the UNLV college campus. This database was created in collaboration with other students at UNLV as a group project. Each picture contains EXIF data, specifically location coordinates, which were used in the tuning of the distance algorithm.
